# Synaptic View for Obsidian

**English** | [ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥](README_KO.md)

**Don't build a homepage. Configure your Synaptic View.**

---

## Stop Building. Start Configuring.

You've spent hours crafting the perfect homepage note:
- Complex **Dataview queries** that break when your vault structure changes
- Dozens of **internal links** that need constant maintenance
- Endless **scrolling** through a static document to find what you need
- **CSS snippets** and workarounds just to make it look decent

**The problem?** You're stuck in maintenance mode, not creative mode.

## Synaptic View Changes the Game

**Stop maintaining a document. Start configuring an interface.**

Synaptic View isn't a note‚Äîit's a **dynamic control center** that lives at your fingertips:
- **No coding required**: Pick icons, choose files, toggle buttons on‚Äîdone in minutes
- **No maintenance**: Your vault structure changes? Your buttons still work
- **No scrolling**: Every destination is one click away, always visible
- **Real-time updates**: See today's tasks without opening notes

**It's not about displaying information. It's about connecting to it instantly.**

**How to use**:
- Open it anytime via command palette: `Open Synaptic View tab`
- Or replace new tabs with Synaptic View for constant access

From janitor to pilot. From static document to living interface. **Configure once, flow forever.**

## FAQ

### Q. Can I use this without Periodic Notes?

A. **Daily Notes Core Plugin** alone is enough for Journal type Day granularity. Week, Month, Quarter, and Year require the **Periodic Notes plugin**.

### Q. Weekly/quarterly/yearly notes aren't showing in Calendar.

A. You must **enable** those time granularities in your Periodic Notes plugin settings. Synaptic View automatically adjusts the UI based on your configuration.

### Q. Daily Note Task Badge isn't updating.

A. Check that the **Show Daily Note task badge** option is enabled in settings. It updates in real-time when you save your daily note.

### Q. Webpages aren't opening with Web type.

A. Some websites (e.g., Google, YouTube) block iframe embedding. These cannot be opened inside Obsidian.
